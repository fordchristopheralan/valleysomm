## Winery Tiers

**Target: 10-15 wineries**

The most established, well-known wineries that visitors expect to see. These validate the platform.

**Characteristics:**

### Tier 2: Hidden Gems
**Target: 15-20 wineries**

Smaller, boutique wineries that benefit most from discovery. These are the "hidden gems" that make ValleySomm valuable.

**Characteristics:**

**Approach:**
- Emphasize discovery and new customer acquisition

- Position as "getting found by the right visitors"

### Tier 3: Complete Coverage
**Target: All remaining Yadkin Valley wineries**

Every winery should be represented, even with basic information.

**Approach:**
- Scrape publicly available data

## FAQ for Winery Conversations

**Q: How much does it cost?**
> Basic listings are always free. We want every Yadkin Valley winery represented. Premium features with analytics and priority placement start at $49/month, but there's no pressure—most wineries start free.

**Q: How do you make money?**
> We have a consumer subscription for unlimited trip planning, and premium winery partnerships. But our core mission is making Yadkin Valley wine tourism better for everyone.

**Q: What data do you collect about our visitors?**
> We share aggregate insights: what visitors are searching for, which wines they prefer, when they're planning trips. We never share individual visitor data without consent.

**Q: How is this different from Yelp/TripAdvisor/Google?**
> We're not a review site—we're a trip planner. We help visitors build complete itineraries matched to their preferences, then deliver those ready-to-visit customers to you.

**Q: Can we control what the AI says about us?**
> Absolutely. You can update your listing anytime with your tagline, description, and key messaging. The AI uses your own words to describe your winery.

**Q: What if visitors have a bad experience?**
> We're building long-term relationships. If something's not working, we want to know. Our goal is happy visitors AND happy wineries.
