# ValleySomm Winery Outreach Email Templates

## Template 1: Initial Outreach (Tier 1 Anchor Wineries)

**Subject:** Founding Partner Invitation - ValleySomm AI Trip Planner

---

Hi [Name],

I'm Chris, founder of ValleySomm—an AI-powered trip planning tool specifically for Yadkin Valley wine country.

I'm reaching out because [Winery Name] is exactly the kind of destination that makes our region special. As I build out our platform, I'd love for you to be one of our founding partners.

**What we're building:**
Visitors tell our AI what they like—wine preferences, group size, vibe—and we create personalized itineraries in minutes. Think of it as a knowledgeable friend who knows every winery in the valley.

**Why this matters for you:**
- Visitors arrive already excited about YOUR wines (pre-matched to their preferences)
- Monthly reports on what visitors are searching for
- Zero cost for basic listings (premium features optional)

**What I'm asking:**
15 minutes to show you the platform and get your feedback. As a founding partner, you'd get premium features free for the first year.

Would next week work for a quick call or coffee?

Best,
Chris Thompson
Founder, ValleySomm

P.S. - I live in the Yadkin Valley area and donate 20% of my consulting hours to local causes. This isn't a Silicon Valley startup—it's a genuine investment in our wine community.

## Template 2: Initial Outreach (Tier 2 Hidden Gems)

**Subject:** Get discovered by wine lovers who'd love [Winery Name]

---

Hi [Name],

I'm building ValleySomm—an AI trip planner for Yadkin Valley wine tourism—and I think [Winery Name] is exactly the kind of hidden gem visitors should discover.

**The problem we're solving:**
Wine tourists are overwhelmed by options. They often stick to the "big names" because they don't know about places like yours. Our AI matches visitors to wineries based on what they actually want.

**How it works for you:**
- We feature your winery to visitors whose preferences match your strengths
- Listings are always free (we want every winery represented)
- You get insights on what visitors are looking for

I've already added [Winery Name] to our database with public information, but I'd love to make sure it's accurate and showcases what makes you special.

**Quick ask:** Could you take 5 minutes to verify your listing?

Or if you'd prefer, I'm happy to visit in person and get the details right.

Cheers,

Just bumping this up—wanted to make sure my note didn't get lost.

Either way, there's no cost and no obligation. I just want Yadkin Valley visitors to discover the best of what we have to offer.
